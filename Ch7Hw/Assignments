Ch 7 Programming Assignment

Ex 7.8 (Write Java Statements... a)... e) )
7.8 Write Java statements to accomplish each of the following tasks:

Display the value of element 6 of array f.

Initialize each of the five elements of one-dimensional integer array g to 8.

Total the 100 elements of floating-point array c.

Copy 11-element array a into the first portion of array b, which contains 34 elements.

Determine and display the smallest and largest values contained in 99-element floating-point array w.




(Ex 7.17) (Dice Rolling)
7.17 (Dice Rolling) Write an application to simulate the rolling of two dice.
The application should use an object of class Random once to roll the first die and again to roll the second die.
The sum of the two values should then be calculated. Each die can show an integer value from 1 to 6, so the sum of the
values will vary from 2 to 12, with 7 being the most frequent sum, and 2 and 12 the least frequent. Figure7.28  shows
the 36 possible combinations of the two dice. Your application should roll the dice 36,000,000 times.
Use a one-dimensional array to tally the number of times each possible sum appears. Display the results in tabular format.

(Ex 7.29a)  (Fibonacci Series)
7.29 (Fibonacci Series) The Fibonacci series

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, â€¦

begins with the terms 0 and 1 and has the property that each succeeding term is the sum of the two preceding terms.

Write a method fibonacci(n) that calculates the nth Fibonacci number. Incorporate this method into an application
that enables the user to enter the value of n.
