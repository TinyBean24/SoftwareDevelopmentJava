## Format for a while statement

initialization;
while (LoopCountinuationCondition) {
    statements
    increment;
}

## For statements are for counter-controlled iteration

## While statement are for sentinel-controlled iteration

##! Both can be used for either iterations but there are instances where a for statement cannot be represented by an equivalent while statement


## Increment counter
counter = counter + 1
counter += 1
++counter  // prefix applies the increment BEFORE the body is executed
counter++  // postfix applies the increment AFTER the body is executed


## Expressions can be contained within a for loop header
    x = 2
    y = 10

    for (int j = x; j <= 4 * x * y; j += y / x)

## is the same as:
    for (int j = 2; j <= 80; j += 5)


// Count from 1 - 100
for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++)

// count from 100 to 1
for (int i = 100; i >= 1; i--)

// count from 7 - 77 in increments of 7
for (int i = 7; i <= 77; i += 7)

// count from 20 - 2 in increments of 2
for (int i = 20; i >= 2; i -= 2)

// count from 2 - 20 in increments of 3
for (int i = 3; i <= 20; i += 3)

// count from 99 - 0 in increments of 11
for (int i = 99; i >= 0; i -= 11)

## For readability limit the size of control-statement headers to a single line if possible

## Avoid calculations in loops where the result never changes Enter those calculations BEFORE the start of the loop
