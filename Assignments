Ch 5 Programming Assignment:

Ex 5.11(Find the Smallest Value)
5.11 (Find the Smallest Value) Write an application that finds the smallest of several integers.
Assume that the first value read specifies the number of values to input from the user.


Ex 5.16(Bar Chart Printing Program)
5.16 (Bar-Chart Printing Program) One interesting application of computers is to display
graphs and bar charts. Write an application that reads five numbers between 1 and 30.
For each number thatâ€™s read, your program should display the same number of adjacent asterisks.
For example, if your program reads the number 7, it should display *******.
Display the bars of asterisks after you read all five numbers.



5.24 (Diamond-Printing Program) Write an application that prints the following diamond shape. You may use output statements that print a single asterisk 
(*), a single space or a single new-line character. Maximize your use of iteration (with nested for statements), and minimize the number of output 
statements.

    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
*********
 *******
  *****
   ***
    *

Ex 5.24(Diamond Printing Program)

Optional

(Ex 5.17)(Calculating Sales)
5.17 (Calculating Sales) An online retailer sells five products whose retail prices are as follows: Product 1, $2.98; product 2, $4.50; product 3, $9.98; product 4, $4.49 and product 5, $6.87. Write an application that reads a series of pairs of numbers as follows:

product number

quantity sold

Your program should use a switch statement to determine the retail price for each product. It should calculate and display the total retail value of all products sold. Use a sentinel-controlled loop to determine when the program should stop looping and display the final results.

(Ex5.25) (Modified Diamond Printing Program)
5.25 (Modified Diamond Printing Program) Modify the application you wrote in Exercise5.24  to read an odd number in the range 1 to 19 to specify the number of rows in the diamond. Your program should then display a diamond of the appropriate size
